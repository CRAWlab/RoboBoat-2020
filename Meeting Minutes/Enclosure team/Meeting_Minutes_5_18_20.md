### Contributions made by: Bradley Este, Thomas Poche, Joseph Stevens

**Cooling System**
***Air cooled system***

 1. Objectives
	 * Volume of enclosure needs to be increased, this size needs to be determined before any calculations are made.
		 * Current internal enclosure dimensions according to CAD model are 20.7 x 10.83 x 5.25 
		 * Robo Boat rules state that an ASV of dimensions greater than: W = 3ft, H = 3ft, L = 6ft will be disqualified. Therefore, adding the new enclosure should not exceed these parameters.
		 * Current ASV dimensions according to CAD model are H = 20.84 in, W = 32 in, L 60 in
		 * Available space, we have 19.25 inches between bolts on top deck and 20.05 inches between rails.
		 * Possible future needs should be considered when determining how much to increase the size of the current enclosure. 
	 * Have airflow coming in, while keeping water and moisture out of the enclosure.
	 * Solve the convection heat transfer problem by determining what temperature difference can be accomplished with chosen fans(fans determined by low power consumption and monetary cost).
	 * Determine how fast the system can get the boards down to a preferred operating temperature.
	 * If any additional heat sink fan is needed, add it
	 * Start calculations at a pre determined temperature with goal to bring down the temp.
	 * Have the fans kick in at a certain temperature and remain off otherwise.
	 * CAD drawing needs to be completed.
	 * Flow simulation needs to be done after model is completed and adjustments to design should be made accordingly.
	 * Need to have enclosure teams section of draft ready for an initial submission by June 3rd 2020.
2. Possible additions to the system
	* Changing the color of the box to help reduce heat absorption from the sun
	* Adding a cover a certain distance above the box to absorb and dissipate heat from the sun (while taking care not to affect camera vision).
	* Adding a temperature gradient inside the box
	* Using a snorkel as a cover for the inlet and exit holes.
	* Possibility of using natural convection through the use of inlet and exit vents.
3. Readings to complete by next meeting
	* Heat Transfer book Chapter 1 section 3
	* Heat Transfer book Chapter 5
	* Heat Transfer with Electronics book chapter 6    
4. Questions for Robo Boat Team
	* Is there an ideal operating temperature that we would like to shoot for?
	* We want to start from a pre-determined max operating temperature and then do calculations of how much and how fast the chosen system can decrease the temperature. Do you guys think we should start with the maximum known operating  temperature that the boards reached during the last competition of 122 degrees F? (Lowest max operating temperature of two boards is: Jetson @ 176 deg F). 
	* Are we putting another Jetson?
		* After adding another Jetson, do we have any idea how much this would contribute to and increase in total temp? 
	* Do we have an idea of how large we would like to make the box, while taking into account future improvements as well?
