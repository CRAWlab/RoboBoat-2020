**Cooling System**
***Air cooled system***
1.  Intake and Exhaust
	* Snorkel air intake with spout and opening pointing downward. 
		* Exhaust and Intake should be symmetrical with respect to each other due to the holonomic capabilities of the boat. This is preferred in order to keep the same functionality when driving in reverse. 
			[Something similar to this, but not exactly](https://www.wish.com/product/598a140c08e12d09fc918b64?hide_login_modal=true&from_ad=goog_shopping&_display_country_code=US&_force_currency_code=USD&pid=googleadwords_int&c=%7BcampaignId%7D&ad_cid=598a140c08e12d09fc918b64&ad_cc=US&ad_curr=USD&ad_price=9.88&campaign_id=7203534630&gclid=Cj0KCQjw1Iv0BRDaARIsAGTWD1un2uznoSLaLp57aooTYjIFVpUlnZ-i83nC90eIvOSy9uJaWBWzo30aAvsEEALw_wcB&share=web)
		* Inlet fan and exhaust fan to create flow of air through system
			[Something like this](https://www.newegg.com/p/1YF-009M-001J3?Description=blower%20fan&cm_re=blower_fan-_-9SIA27CAK71375-_-Product)
			[Or like this](https://www.newegg.com/nonoise-g5015m12d1-6-fans/p/1YF-002N-00090?Item=9SIA6254FA5101&quicklink=true)
		* Possible safety system with two closing flaps shuts off all outside environments when IMU board indicates tipping past a certain point.
		* Water resistant membrane that allows air flow
2. Internals
	* Heat sink with fan in middle to pull heat directly from the source. This would transfer heat from the from the aluminum base board to the 4 heat pipes through the coils and be carried out with the flow of air created by the intake and exhaust fans.
		[Heat sink example here](https://www.amazon.com/Noctua-NH-U12S-Premium-Cooler-NF-F12/dp/B00C9EYVGY/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=noctua%20nh-u12s&qid=1585513334&sr=8-3)

***Plan of Action***
1. Decision made to switch focus to an air cooled system first
	 * Design is more simplistic and may be a part of a more complicated design in the future if it is determined that a more complicated design is need. E.I. may have some type of integration between water and air cooled system.
	 * The idea was to start here and if it a greater need is determined after further investigation and calculation to move to a more complicated system.
	 *  Concerns of water system intake pipe and exit pipe creating drag would be avoided if successful.
2. Team is going to begin research in "Heat Transfer 10th Edition" by J.P. Holman to start modeling the system and begin doing calculations. We believe this is the next step and we have a good decent general mapping of a system to begin investigation.
3. Need to get a copy of 2019 team report for specs
4. Need to get a boat dimensions for proper system design
5. Team would like a subteam folder in the Github Robo Boat 2020 folder to keep meeting notes and system part links in the same spot for ease of access.
