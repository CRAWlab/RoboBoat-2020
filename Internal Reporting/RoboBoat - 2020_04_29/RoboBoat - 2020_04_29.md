I don't really have much to say here. I'm planning on looking at the GitHub website design tools Friday after my 10:00 lecture, if we have one. I also have not yet looked up any of the past videos from prevous years' competitions.

RoboNation has not yet uploaded submission instructions to answer any of our questions from the Tuesday meeting.

I think the best course of action is to develop a high-level technical report outline, which I'll also do Friday, post it in Markdown form in this report, and assign team members to certain sections that correspond to what they should have been working on. This should be something like the following that I've been using for past reports, with a few additional sections as needed to describe the physical components, sensor suite, etc. I'll also utilize prior teams' reports for inspiration on this.
